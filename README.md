# mobile-health-app-collection
This is only a collection including all the mobile health related Android apps that I have completed. Each of these projects has a corresponding individual repository.

## [Motion Visualizer](https://github.com/icycoke/motion-visualizer)
A simple Android app which can visualize the data from specific motion sensors.

## [Musical Pedometer](https://github.com/icycoke/musical-pedometer)
Musical Pedometer can display the user's exercise track in real-time while the user is running, and record related exercise data in the background. At the same time, this software will perform real-time pattern recognition based on the user's exercise data, and play different music based on the recognition results. After the user finishes the exercise, the software will summarize and analyze the data collected in this period of exercise, and show the user a simple exercise report.

## [Medication Reminder](https://github.com/icycoke/medication-reminder)
A self-management application designed for patients with heart disease. Medication Reminder can help the user easily add a new event to Google Calendar to prevent missing it. Furthermore, it can record the user's home location and use geo-fence to push notification when the user is leaving home to remind him/her to keep the necessary medicine.
